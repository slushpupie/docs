## THE COMMUNITIES OF THE OPEN VOICE NETWORK:  
## REMIT, GOVERNANCE, CULTURE AND CODE OF CONDUCT

As approved 2020.07.13 by the Steering Committee of the Open Voice Network. 

### INTRODUCTION
The Open Voice Network (OVN) is dedicated to making voice assistance worthy of user trust, and doing so through the development, proposal, and adoption of technical standards and ethical use guidelines.

History teaches that broad and deep, communal involvement in the development of standards and usage guidelines is a key to widespread adoption and implementation.   For that reason, it is essential that The Open Voice Network develop and nurture a wide range of actively-engaged user communities.   

Indeed, the last word of our name – “Network” – affirms that the OVN will be a network of communities, perhaps even a community of communities.

OVN communities will form in four areas:  voice industry practitioners (Developer, Designer-strategist), geographic regions (Europe, China), vertical industries, (Health & Life Sciences, Education Steering Team, Commerce), and ethical use.   

Membership is open to all who wish to participate; participants from “voice innovator” firms (as defined in the OVN Charter) may wish to officially affiliate as an OVN “Supporter,” and share the OVN logo on personal or business sites.   

Interested parties may join (and participate in) as many OVN Communities as time and priorities permit.

Community members will participate through the Slack instant-messaging and document-sharing tool, through cloud-based document development and storage drives, and when appropriate on the OVN GitHub repository.  Questions and documents will be posted for comment and community discussion.  On occasion, conference calls will be scheduled to provide information and updates.  

### OPEN VOICE NETWORK COMMUNITIES: REMIT, GOVERNANCE, AND CULTURE

**1  The Remit of the OVN Communities.**

All OVN Communities are responsible for the following:

•	To inform and advise the work of The OVN as it addresses:
o 	* Technical standards definition, research, prioritization, and development
o	  * Enterprise industry value proposition and use case research, documentation, and development.
o	  * Ethical use.

•	To lift the knowledge, proficiency, and market value of all OVN Community members through the sharing of information and rich dialogue.

•	To raise the awareness of the value of standards and of The OVN within the greater and global voice, digital marketing and consulting, and enterprise decision-making communities. 

Each OVN Community may also choose to pursue other objectives, as determined by the community and led by its moderators.  

It is expected that the objectives of each OVN Community will be pursued through engagement:

•	In a community of individuals that is diverse (across multiple vectors), smart, and committed
•	in a safe environment, one in which ideas can explored without fear
•	on behalf of the OVN with the broader voice world. 

**Regarding the use of OVN Communities for personal gain:**

a)	The use of the OVN Communities for sales or personal financial gain Is not permitted.  Participants in OVN Communities are welcome to share blog posts, conferences, invitations to seminars, job postings, and other resources which may be relevant to the remit of the OVN Communities and of value to Community members.  However, we will not accept – and will ask members to remove – notices that serve to promote products or services for personal financial gain.   

b)	Unsolicited sales or product pitches to OVN sponsoring enterprises by OVN Community members are not permitted. 

**2 The Governance of the OVN Communities.** 

OVN Communities can be formed by any self-identifying (expertise, geography, industry, or ethical use) group of individuals who share the vision and support the strategy of The Open Voice Network.   Community formation will first be recognized by the OVN Executive Director, and then affirmed by The Steering Committee.  The establishment of Slack Channels and Slack access will be managed by The Executive Director. 

All OVN Communities will be led by OVN Community Moderators.  These individuals will be volunteers, and members of the Communities that they serve.

Community Moderators are responsible for:

•	Growth in Community membership, diversity, and active participation.  This may include the issuance  of both individual invitations and to existing voice organizations.  (A goal: to become a Community of Communities of Communities.) 
  
•	Sparking and guiding the Community’s real-time meetings and Slack Channel discussions.  

•	Moderating the Community’s real-time meetings and Slack Channel discussions.  Serving, if and when needed, as referees and a calming presence. 

•	Serving as official advocates and liaisons between the Community and the OVN standing committees.  

In real-time meetings or online discussions, moderators will be expected to
•	Provide participants with opportunities to contribute suggestions or criticisms; 
•	Prevent the monopolization of meetings by one or more individuals;
•	Encourage attendees to document suggestions-thoughts into the Community Slack Channel (as writing often clarifies the topic, as well as preserve the concept);
•	Encourage discussion but discourage arguments ("Take it off-line" often enables discussions to get back on course);
•	Demonstrate polite professionalism, and insist on tolerance to all ideas.
Moderators are expected to work with the executive director to establish meeting dates (up to 3 months in advance), agendas, and meeting logistics.

**3 The Culture of the OVN Communities.**

We believe the following: 

1.	Ideas can grow to standards when they 1) emerge from a community of diversity and depth, and 2) are adopted (to economic benefit) by leading users.
2.	A community can create the optimum value for the most when it is diverse in intellectual perspective, regional affiliation, gender, age, and ethnicity.  
3.	Robust disagreement has the power to accelerate knowledge most productively when pursued through careful listening and civil discourse. 
4.	Standards for conversational AI must be pursued with a student’s humility, which includes respect for precedent, a searching and questioning mind, and a thirst for new knowledge. 
5.	While we will applaud hard work, we recognize that what matters most is the fulfillment of milestone promises, at-or-above expectations, and on time.
